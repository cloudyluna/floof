## Features

- `tung_forest` biome with tung trees and generated solid bouncy clouds in the sky.
- Tung tools.

### Tung

Pickaxe, axe and shovel tools. Can remove blocks very quickly.

#### Ores & Ingots

- Tung ore. Requires more or stronger fuel source to smelt. Shares depth and rarity of gold ores.
- Tung ingot. The product when tung ore has been smelted. Can be crafted into
powerful Tung tools.

#### Tree

- Leaves have a chance to drop a coal lump along with sapling.

- Tree log/trunk could drop a block of tung ore, diamond gem or a coal lump. ***Must use one of the Tung tools to chop the log for these loot drops***.

- Cosmetic effect: Leaves will emit smoke and fire particles indefinitely.

### Pendulum

#### Clouds

![](screenshots/clouds.png)

- Solid, semi-transparent bouncy clouds in the sky which can only be found in `tung_forest` biome. Player can break them and use as building blocks.
